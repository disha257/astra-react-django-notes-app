## Get Started
To build and play with this app, follow the build instructions that are located here: [INSTRUCTIONS_LINK](INSTRUCTIONS_LINK)

<!--- Everything below Get Started should be excluded from the Astra UI --->
<!--- STARTEXCLUDE --->
<!--- ENDEXCLUDE --->

<!--- Enter the repository name --->
# Running {name}
Follow the instructions below to get started.

<!--- 
Modify this section as needed, however always include the Astra DB setup parts
--->
## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup by creating a serverless(!) database.

### DataStax Astra
<!--- enter a unique UTM_CODE for your sample app below --->
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=UTM_CODE) if you don't already have one:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-register-basic-auth.png)

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Create Database`**
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-dashboard.png)

3. Locate the **`Get Started`** button to continue
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-select-plan.png)

4. Define a **database name**, **keyspace name** and select a database **region**, then click **create database**.
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-create-db.png)

5. Your Astra DB will be ready when the status will change from *`Pending`* to **`Active`** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ 
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-active.png)

6. After your database is provisioned, we need to generate an Application Token for our App. Go to the `Settings` tab in the database home screen.
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-settings.png)

1. Select `Admin User` for the role for this Sample App and then generate the token. Download the CSV so that we can use the credentials we need later.

<!--- 
When connecting via an API, use the connect screen step below
--->
1. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and copy the connection information that we'll need later. We'll replace `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` with the `Token` value that is part of your Application Token.

<!--- 
When connecting with a secure bundle, use the service account steps below
--->
1. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and select the driver connection that we need. Go ahead and download the `Secure Bundle` for the driver.
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-connect-bundle.png)

9. Make note of where to use the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` that is part of the Application Token that we generated earlier.

### Github
<!-- Enter your GITHUB_URL below -->
1. Click `Use this template` at the top of the [GitHub Repository](GITHUB_URL):
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/github-use-template.png)

2. Enter a repository name and click 'Create repository from template':
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/github-create-repository.png)

3. Clone the repository:

<!--- 
Include locally as a minimum so that folks will
create an Astra DB and use your repository as a template.

Remove paths that you don't need.
